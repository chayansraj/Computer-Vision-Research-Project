Parameter 'transform'=<function preprocess at 0x7f41e06d8d30> of the transform datasets.arrow_dataset.Dataset.set_format couldn't be hashed properly, a random hash was used instead. Make sure your transforms and parameters are serializable with pickle or dill for the dataset fingerprinting and caching to work. If you reuse this transform, the caching mechanism will consider it to be different from the previous calls and recompute everything. This warning is only showed once. Subsequent hashing failures won't be showed.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k were not used when initializing ViTForImageClassification: ['pooler.dense.weight', 'pooler.dense.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing ViTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing ViTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of ViTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
